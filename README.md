# CODEX-PROJECT


𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: 

CODEX Market Analysis Project is a data analysis project for a German Food and Beverage company. I worked on this project independently and leveraged SQL for data analysis as well as python.

▪️𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚:

The dataset consisted of 10,000 records and was structured into three tables - dm_cities, dm_respondents, and fact_survey_responses. It included information about respondents, their preferences, brand perceptions, and purchase behavior.

▪️𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲: 

To begin, I comprehended the dataset and built a data model. Using SQL functions and commands like aggregations, joins, and window functions, I analyzed the data to derive valuable insights for the Marketing team.

▪️𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬: 

The analysis revealed insights like the preferred energy drink consumption frequency, age group preferences, most effective marketing channels, and factors influencing purchase decisions. Additionally, I identified the top competitors and reasons behind brand preferences.

▪️𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐬: 

By understanding consumer preferences and market trends, CODEX can tailor marketing campaigns, enhance brand reputation, and strategize product development. The insights also guide pricing strategies and improve brand penetration in specific cities.
